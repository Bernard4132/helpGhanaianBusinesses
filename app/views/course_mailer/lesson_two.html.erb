<span style="font-weight: 700">Marketing that leads to a sale!</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">In today’s lesson we will learn that marketing and sales are not the same. Secondly we will learn that marketing should lead to a sale. Thirdly we will understand why it is important to measure your marketing results in order to spend wisely.</span> 
<br><br>

Marketing and Sales. Similar but not same!
 According to the global encyclopedia, Wikipedia, Marketing is basically used to create, keep and satisfy the customer. In marketing, the customer should be the focus. It is very important to know that marketing is not sales. Sales on the other is the most important aspect of every marketing campaign. Sales is the best way to measure our marketing efforts. It is the most important but don’t let only sales mislead you.<br><br> For every successful sale, there has been a successful promotion, lead generator, ad copy, sales page, the list goes on.
I mean to say that a sale happens when a buying transaction happens between a customer and a business. Many things cause this to happen and all I am saying is that we shouldn’t ignore them too. 
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 700">Eventually we want the Sale!</span><br><br>

Very often I find Businesses investing in a lot of mediums (radio, TV, newspapers, paper publicity and so on.) as a way of marketing their business to make "the" sale.
Honestly, most mediums businesses use to market their businesses are almost dead or even if not dead, on their way to their respective graves). Even if those mediums work, the results you get are very small compared to how much you invest into them.
<br><br>
Marketing should be measurable so you know how much you are spending exactly on what. This helps you to track as you are spending and know whether your campaigns are being profitable or not.
Supposing you pay 10,000 cedis to Peace fm to market your products for a month. How do you measure exactly results from such a campaign… Phone calls? Emails of potential customers? People talking about your business?<br><br> 
Rightly, we have to understand that sales is a process and not an event. This process includes marketing. Marketing is an event which happens during sales. Breaking this down into varios pieces will help you measure your marketing and help you spend wisely on your marketing campaigns.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 700;">We will continue our next lesson tomorrow. Audience building and how Kwame Despite builds his business empires! We will break that down for you. It is pure marketing and can be the differentiator between making scanty sales to not being able to manage sales inflows. See you tomorrow in your inbox!</span>
