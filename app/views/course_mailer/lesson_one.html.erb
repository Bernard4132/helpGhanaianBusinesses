<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 14px;">[Lesson 1 <span style="font-weight: 300;">out of</span> 7]</span><br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 700">Why & How do you market your business? Gain a deeper Perspective!</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">As a business owner, marketing does not come to you as a firsthand.</span> Very much often your craft comes first then the ability to manage whatever you have, then the others follow in a like manner.
Not having firsthand learning in marketing means you are prone to make lots of mistakes when we try our hands on it.<br><br> Truly, we do a lot of wrong things with good intentions in mind. I wrote this email course with you in mind and all I want is to help show the businessman/entrepreneur the right way and means to market themselves to the world and see actual results using the internet. <br><br>The internet is the greatest tool in our age now and Businesses ought to learn how to use it to grow their businesses greatly.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 700;"> Sales & Marketing vs Purpose</span><br><br>
Every business owner has to know that sales is the life of their business and the only engine of growth for their business therefore they shouldn’t put it off at all. We hear people say every time that when you have a great product, you can grow even without marketing. That’s a big lie. Why because your customer cannot try all products (<span style="font-weight: 500;">because without good marketing, you look like everyone else</span>) to see which is best.<br><br> Rightly said, it should be <span style="font-style: italic;">“A good product and a good marketing team are assured great success”.</span> On the other hand, if you have a bad product, no amount of marketing can save you. Also, note that people are offering average products with great marketing and making millions of Ghana cedis in revenue whiles really great products with bad marketing are sitting on shelves waiting to be bought.
<br><br>
Marketing is more about effectively positioning your brand in the minds of your customers/clients and prospective customers/clients. It is not about price wars. Providing unnecessary discounts here and there. Price wars are never a great thing for any business. Businesses are always left worse off.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 700;">We will continue our next lesson tomorrow. Marketing should lead to a sale or eventually lead to sale. If your marketing is not doing that you’ve got to Audit it! See you tomorrow in your inbox!</span>
