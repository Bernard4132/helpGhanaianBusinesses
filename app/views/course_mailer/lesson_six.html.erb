<span style="font-weight: 700">Set yourself up for Success!</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Every business that wants to succeed online needs to have a clearly defined strategy. This is no longer optional but a ‘must have’ for businesses who want results in this age of internet marketing.</span> 
<br><br>

As an internet marketer, one of my tasks is to explain to my clients why they need to have a complete marketing and audience building strategy and how to make it work for the benefit of their business. Here is what to do to set your business up for marketing success in this internet world.
<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: 700">1. Set your Goals</span><br><br>
If you’re just starting out, a successful marketing plan will take more time to put together. Since you don’t have a lot of information to feed off of, you’ll have to evaluate your business and marketing strategies in a different way. But first, you need to set business goals before you plan your marketing strategy.
 <br><br>
Business goals will help guide you in the right direction with your marketing plan. For instance, say you want to build your email list to 3,000 subscribers by the end of 2018. That main goal will give you an area to focus on.
Make sure each main goal is pretty specific, so it is actionable. The more specific a goal is, the better your marketing plan will be.
<br><br> 
Think about each area of your business. Consider if you want to create goals for these areas and add them to your marketing plan. A few aspects to consider include:
<br><br> 
-Products or services you plan to provide and how you want to market them.<br>
-Marketing tools you want to use to help you achieve these goals.<br>
-Who you need on your team to help you achieve these goals.<br>
-Possible strategies to use for your marketing plan.<br><br> 
 
After figuring out what you want to achieve, you now have the foundation of your marketing plan!
<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: 700">2. Decide on which internet marketing tools to use</span><br><br>
I mentioned above that internet marketing has a number of tools but if you try and use everything at once (without having the experience and personnel), it’s not a good idea.
What you should do instead is decide which tools to start using by following these:
<br><br>  
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) – Takes time to generate results and it is an ongoing process. As a first step, you need to ensure that your on-page SEO is correct and then plan for the rest of the SEO tasks (off-page SEO, more content etc) as part of your monthly process.
<br><br> 
Social Media – You need to do it from day 1. Social media may not produce immediate or direct results but it is a must for every online business. Social media is mostly used for audience building. Use social media to build a cult like following for your business.
<br><br> 
Email Marketing -  Email marketing is still one of the most important digital marketing tools. It should be part of your digital marketing strategy as a way to promote your business and also as a conversion goal i.e. one of your goals should be to increase your email list using all available techniques.
<br><br> 
Content marketing – Content marketing is these days more important than ever. If you think about it, the web is all about content and having the right content published in your website can make a big difference for success or failure.
I won’t go into many details here but remember that content is important for getting traffic from SEO and Social media and also for converting visitors into customers.
<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: 700">3. Measure your results and iterate.</span><br><br>
As you will start using these internet tools and applying the tactics in your business, you will start seeing results. How do you use this information to create better campaigns and devise better strategies? Here are a few things to consider when measuring your results.<br><br>
-       Unique website visitors<br>
-       Top ranking content<br>
-       Social fan Growth<br>
-       Social media post performance<br>
-       Qualified leads from marketing<br><br>
Every business, small or large, needs to have an internet marketing and audience building strategy. The strategy should include (among other things) what tools to use, how to use each tool, what to expect from it and how you measure progress.

<br><br>
