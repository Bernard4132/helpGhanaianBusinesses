<span style="font-weight: 700">Advertising that brings value to you customer.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">The simple thing about marketing is that we are more psychologically inclined to buy from someone especially when we have trust in them and importantly when we believe in their brand. Their brand has an authority over us. Very often when we run advertisements, we are too blunt with our offers and do not spend time building brand equity which in the long run will pay of greatly. <br><br>In the present “Thank you Economy”, brands grow by giving value to their customers to establish brand authority. This helps one get more consistent and regular buyers because these people now believe in your Thesis.<br><br>
Here is an example I often use. Let’s say you sell real estate properties. Instead of bluntly putting out houses and their prices. Why don’t you spend time first telling them about why they need a house, about its benefits and its long run advantage to them. By giving them a reason to buy, they are more likely to buy from you. You can also share with them helpful tips on finding a good house and other things that are valuable to them. You will find them buying from you more, than when you sell to them quite bluntly.<br><br>
In marketing, one of the hardest things to do is marketing to people who do not know your brand. The easiest way to do that is to bring them value. By so doing, they will be more inclined to buy from you or even recommend you to a friend, colleague or their family.</span>
