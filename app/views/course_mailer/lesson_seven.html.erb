<span style="font-weight: 700">Maximizing your Sales potential to disproportionately Scale your Business (Multi-Million cedis)</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">At the end of the day all the monies spent on adverts is all for one reason, Sales. Sales is the ultimate goal when it comes to marketing. But selling is not the right approach to get more from your marketing campaigns. How should we maximize our sales potential as a business?</span> 
<br><br>



<span style="font-weight: 700">Audience Building</span><br><br>
Here is it. Audience Building. One of the least understood and underutilized themes in marketing including internet marketing (modify for social media content). On Facebook for example, people just buy page likes without understanding the underlying reason behind a page like. When someone likes your page on Facebook, it means they are interested in your brand and would like to buy from you. With this in mind, why do you go ahead to buy page likes from bots, who are not even humans to buy things from you.<br><br>
For example, if you sell kitchen ware, it is necessary to build an Audience around young and married women. These are the people who are more likely to buy from you. Having men and younger men in your audience will be bad for you since your conversion rates are going to be very bad.<br><br>
A small and a sharp audience will give you a lot more results than a large and blunt audience. Make it a focus of yours and your business to attract people who are more likely to vibe with your brand.

<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: 700">Scaling your Business with sales</span><br><br>
In business, it is quite impossible to scale your business without working sales. Think of that businesses that have better products than their competition but because of their bad sales and marketing strategies, they are not able to grow. When I was doing freelance website building, there were guys who knew how to build more beautiful websites than I did but they I used to get more clients than them because I knew how to position myself in the market to be seen by clients, especially high value clients.<br><br>
The difference between Coca-Cola and Afri-cola is brand positioning. Coke products don’t differ in taste much. Sometimes marketing even influences the way your products is perceived and might influence taste in the case of Coca-Cola. Good marketing can be the major differentiator between businesses that scale to millions in revenue and companies that don’t. To grow your business, just fix sales.<br><br>
The internet has given every company freely the ability to scale their businesses without any middle man. The internet has created a lot of millionaires and billionaires. Radio and TV have had their time. The blunt truth is that they are not as effective as they were when they were at their peak. In 1981, the most valuable company in the world was steel company owned by Andrew Carnegie. <br><br>The reason was that steel was a new technology which was revolutionizing businesses and consumer products. Steel was used in almost everything. Even in your home right now, steel can be found in about 85% of things you have at home (kitchen ware, spoons, TV’s, computers, just name them.)<br><br>
Just as steel changed the world, the internet is doing same in our day and Age. All the top 10 most valuable companies in the world are internet companies providing services. These companies won’t be valued greatly if they were not changing and redefining the status quo. The internet is not just mere; it is the greatest advantage of the 21st century. It is an engine of growth and it is the engine of growth that will take your business to new and exciting heights!
